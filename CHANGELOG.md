## 4.0.7 - Latest

- A bunch of improvements and optimizations (minor changes from the rework)
- MAJOR thanks to [ruicanas](https://github.com/ruicanas) for fixing and improving the iOS implementation!

## 4.0.0

- A major rework of the `QRCode` class to allow for easy creation of nice looking QRCodes
- Added the first version of the iOS Support
- Changed the base package of the classes from `io.github.g0dkar.qrcode` to `qrcode`
  - This was done to better support JavaScript
  ÃŸ- And because I don't really see much use in those Java-ish package names ðŸ˜…

## 3.3.0

- Started doing the Changelog ðŸ¥²
- Added plain release files to the [release](release) directory (only the latest version will be there)
- Added JavaScript (Browser) into Multiplatform support
    - Added Browser JS QRCode Generation example ([link](examples/js/qrcode-example.html))
    - **Still needs some improvements** on how people use it, but it is a step in the right direction
    - **Help in this regard is much appreciated!** If interested, this is in the domain of Developer Experience, aka
      DevX/DX
- Changed uses of `Collection`s to `Array`s instead to try and be more performant and have a smaller library as a result
- **WIP:** Started work on Native targets (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS)
